# atom-cerebral-signal-bootstrap package

### Expirimental.. more info soon!

Quickly bootstrap signals/chains by adding imports and generating the different files.



**important:** It expects :

```js
export default [/* Anything */];
```

Note the semi-colon `;`, this is required.

It does not support inline functions, arrow functions. For now.
